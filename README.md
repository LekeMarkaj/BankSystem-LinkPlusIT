Bank System Application
This application is a simple banking system that allows users to create banks and accounts, perform transactions, and check balances.

How to Run the Application

I have done it with spring boot and react js.
So firstly u should run the intellij and then in the terminal write cd frontend and the after npm start.

There are two roles, one is a user and one is a admin.
The admin is already added in the database hardcoded, the user should be added with the register form.

The first thing you should do as an admin is create a bank, add its name and fees.
After that you can see all the bank accounts registered.

The first thing you can do as a user, you should register and then login.
Then You should choose a bank you prefere, after choosing a bank it sends you to all the banks you have.
Then after choosing a bank you can perform transactions,
you can withdraw if you have more than 10 dollars and deposit at any time,
and you can also deposit to someone else if you have enough funds.

You can see the history of your transactions and you account balance at the top.

Note: the security is not the best and the error messages are not the best in the world, but i did what i could with all the time i had.

With all respect,

Leke Markaj.
